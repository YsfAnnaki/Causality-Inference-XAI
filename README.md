Worked on this research project from June, 2020 to September, 2021 at the Elie Cartan Institute of Lorraine (IECL) and with the collaboration of Inria Paris.

Research done under the supervision of Marianne Clausel (Univ. Lorraine) & Geaorges Oppenheim (Centre de math√©matiques d'Orsay).


## Summary

The aim of this work is to explore more in depth the concept of causality between time series and stochastic processes as well as it inference and to come up with a new approach to this topic.

The research goal relies on our desire to link the world of explainable machine learning with the notion of causality for the analysis of the interaction between time series. More precisely, given a time serie prediction model (regressions, AR models, RNN, ...), we would like to know what are the past events (point in time) of this time serie (or any other time serie used to build the prediction model) that contribute the most to the construction of the prediction. This "contribution" can be seen as causality relationship between past events and predictions. As an example, if we would like to build a stock returns prediction model, we might also be interested in selecting the past price moves / volatility regimes / events that influence the most our prediction process.
